â”‚   
â””â”€â”€â”€deployment/ -> all your deployment and stack creation template and settings
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€ ecs-stack.json -> cloudformation template to create ECS stack
```

### Getting started
- Clone the repository
- Install NodeJS, NPM and Docker
- Run `npm i` inside the repo folder
- Run `npm run start` to build and run the project locally 
- npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name migration-skeleton will create a new migration skeleton
- Run `npm run test` to run migrations on local test setup


### Prerequisite
Before you build or run the server locally, you should start docker and run
```bash
docker-compose up -d or docker compose up -d
```
To pull down the docker containers
```bash
docker-compose down or docker compose down
```

### Environment
To run this project locally you need to set following env vars
- PORT
- DB_PORT
- DB_HOST
- DB_USER
- DB_PASS
- DB_NAME

### Build
- run `npm run build` for local build
- run `npm run build:docker` for local docker build

### Run locally
- run `npm run start` for local run
- run `npm run start:docker` for local docker run

### Deployment
Before you deploy this project, you need to configure your AWS CLI and AWS account
- create ECR repository, and push your docker image and then get the repo URL
- upload `deployment/ecs-stack.json` to Cloudformation dashboard > create on AWS
- provide the config details and ECR url and finish the stack creation

You can also validate the template using
```bash
aws cloudformation validate-template \
  --template-body file://deployment/rds.template
```

### Suggestions
- use [cfn-lint](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint) to validate and lint cloudformation configs (JSON/YAML) locally
- use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run and test your GitHub actions locally instead of try to push and then wait to run and see results

Once your stack is up and running, you can then configure CI/CD pipeline to run the
test `npm run test` and lint `npm run lint`, then build the docker image and push to ECR. The server deployment
will be automatically updated with the latest ECR image

-- Happy coding  ðŸ˜‰
